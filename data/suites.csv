        | `time.sleep(10)` | Waits blindly for 10 seconds, even if element is ready earlier       | ‚ùå Wasteful and unreliable             |

        | `FluentWait`     | Like WebDriverWait, but **customizable**: poll frequency, exceptions | ‚úÖ Advanced control over wait strategy |

You need Fluent Wait when:
üëâ Timing is uncertain
üëâ You want smarter retry logic
üëâ You want to poll repeatedly for a condition without over-waiting
üëâ You need control over the waiting behavior","13566","Wait for the input field to become enabled using Fluent Wait","","Thu Aug 28 12:52:26 UTC 2025","passed","Thu Aug 28 12:52:40 UTC 2025","","","",""
