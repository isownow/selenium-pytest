        | `time.sleep(10)` | Waits blindly for 10 seconds, even if element is ready earlier       | ‚ùå Wasteful and unreliable             |

You need Fluent Wait when:

üëâ You want smarter retry logic
üëâ You want to poll repeatedly for a condition without over-waiting
üëâ You need control over the waiting behavior","8991","Wait for the input field to become enabled using Fluent Wait","","Tue Aug 19 09:26:15 UTC 2025","passed","Tue Aug 19 09:26:24 UTC 2025","","","",""
