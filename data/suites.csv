        | `time.sleep(10)` | Waits blindly for 10 seconds, even if element is ready earlier       | ‚ùå Wasteful and unreliable             |
        | `WebDriverWait`  | Waits for a specific condition with default polling every 0.5 sec    | ‚úÖ Great for most cases                |
        | `FluentWait`     | Like WebDriverWait, but **customizable**: poll frequency, exceptions | ‚úÖ Advanced control over wait strategy |

You need Fluent Wait when:
üëâ Timing is uncertain
üëâ You want smarter retry logic
üëâ You want to poll repeatedly for a condition without over-waiting
üëâ You need control over the waiting behavior","4853","Wait for the input field to become enabled using Fluent Wait","","Mon Aug 18 17:00:00 UTC 2025","passed","Mon Aug 18 17:00:04 UTC 2025","","","",""
